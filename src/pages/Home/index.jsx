          Hi my name is Nilesh Patel. I am an aspiring web developer. I currently work as an optometrist but feel itâ€™s time for a change.
          I have a  honorary bachelor of science degree to my name, for which I am proud of but I feel web developing is my calling, I hope to progress further in the field of programming and move into the game development world. 
          <br /> <br />
          I grew up playing awesome games such as Zelda, Mario smash Bros, Halo and Assassins Creed to name a few! I have always been intrigued on how games are made.
          <br /> <br />
          I am now a proud father to my one year old daughter and try and be the best role model for her as she grows up.
          <br /> <br />
          I am currently completing the very first Trillogy 24-week Bootcamp course in the UK. The course focuses on HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Node.js, Express, MySQL, MongoDB, Handlebars.js and React.js.
          <br /> <br />
          Feel free to look through my portfolio and you can contact me via email or LinkedIn.
